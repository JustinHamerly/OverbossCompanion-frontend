      <h2>What is Overboss Companion?</h2>
      <p>Overboss Companion is an app to help with the setup of your Overboss games.  The app will allow you to create games and shuffle tiles so the physical shuffling can be skipped in setup!  Also, you can save your games to your account and keep track of the current tile selection options, as well as keep track of discard piles and user turns.</p>
